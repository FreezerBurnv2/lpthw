# Study Drills

#1 Above each line, use the # to write a comment to yourself explaining what the line does.
#2 Remember in Ex 0 when you started python? Start python this way again and using above characters and what you know, use python as a calculator
#3 Find something you need ot calculate and write a new .py file that does it.
#4 Notice the math seems "wrong"? There are no fractions, only whole numbers. Find out why by researching what a "floating point" number is.
#5 Rewrite ex3.py to use floating point numbers so it's more accurate (hint: 20.0 is floating point)
